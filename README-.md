### Screenshot

Screenshot provided in the files

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

The process that I followed was fairly simple and involved 2 steps:
-arranging all the required HTML elements on the page
-styling them using css

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

Even though this is really a simple problem statyement this is the first time I've been able to replicate something without following someone along and this gives me immense joy.
-I solidified the principles of positioning and have grown very comfortable with how to place elements onto the screen ,which earlier used to be the cause of great pain.
-I learnt to effectively search for solutions to the problems that I am facing using google.



### Continued development

My css code looks a bit cluttered and I'm not comfortable with making responsive pages yet .So these are the two things that I would like to fix in the upcoming iterations of this project.


### Useful resources

(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me getting into the details of how to use something and how it's expected to behave.	
(https://devdocs.io/) - This is just amazing and so easy to glance and get things done. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who's beginning out and reading the mdn documentations isn't a cup of tea for you.
